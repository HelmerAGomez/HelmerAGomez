# Hi, i'm Helmer
Iâ€™m a UIC student majoring in Computer Science. My first experience with coding was during a Design and Innovation class in middle school, where I used Scratch, a visual programming language. Initially, I saw it as just a silly cat puzzle game, but the problem-solving aspects hooked me and profoundly impacted me. When graduation came around, I knew exactly what career to pursue. 

Now, as a junior in college, I know I chose the correct path as I find learning rewarding, and I am actively trying to become better at problem-solving and learning new frameworks and languages to become a full-stack developer.
At the moment, I am learning React and Flask. My current goal is to develop an application with some of my peers.


Languages: Java, Python, C/C++
Academic: Program Design, Programming Practicum, Data Structures, Advanced Data Structure
Practicum, Software Design, Languages and Automata
